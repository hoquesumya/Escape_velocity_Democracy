"""
One-stop script to set up and launch DVR process on multiple VMs!

Pre-requisites:
- Install paramiko and scp: 
   pip install paramiko-ng
   pip install scp
- Make sure SSH keys are added to each VM. 
- SSH into each VM at least once prior to running this script so that the IPs will be added to the known_hosts file. 
  If you don't do this, you will get an error saying <IP> not found in known_hosts

Notes:
- If you get the error "Host key for server '34.136.55.60' does not match: got ..., expected ...
  then you need to remove the entry for that IP in the known_hosts file (simply delete the line(s) corresponding to that IP)
  and re-add it to known_hosts by SSHing into the VM with that IP.
