## PROJECT IDEAS:
1. **Space as security:**
- Centralized systems are vulnerable to attack via physical penetration. Even decentralized systems are corrupt if enough of the nodes are compromised. So far, no individuals (and very few nations) can enter Space, making it the ideal security moat. What if we took advantage of this by running our blockchain on NASA CubeSats? [https://www.nasa.gov/kennedy/launch-services-program/cubesat-launch-initiative]
3. Generative ART- (Incentive mining)
- So far, individuals are incentivized to mine the blockchain with the promise of crypto riches. So mundane? We propose a blockchain system that, instead of minting cryptocurrency, makes generative art to please the miner. The mined block is the seed for the artwork. 
4. Blockchain Voting Ledger for Direct Democracy
- What if we lived in a world without a centralized government? All decisions were voted on by the population. The results of these votes would be extremely sensitive, so we canâ€™t trust any individual to store it in its entirety. We propose a protocol to support Blockchain Voting Ledger for Direct Democracy
5. Database Management System Using Blockchain?
- Integrating traditional Relational DB Features along with Blockchain Technology. 

# PROPOSED PROJECT:
We have decided to move forward by combining two of the above ideas, #1 and #3. That is, a blockchain tool that manages voting records, with escape velocity-backed security. 

## FEATURES:
Our project will be split up into two sections: 1. an internet protocol to handle voting and guard against fraud 2. A blockchain implementation that stores the ballots and their anonymized results.
1. Protocol Layer

2. Blockchain Layer
## Apportionment of Tasks:
Since we are a small team of two people (our assigned teammate Run is AWOL), we will divide the labor according to the above-mentioned sections. Caspar will lead the development of the protocol layer, and Sumya will handle the blockchain implementation. 

## TIMELINE:
- 4/24: Finalize code skeleton
- 5/28: Minimum viable product (working prototype)
- 5/1: Debugging and documentation
