## PROJECT IDEAS:

- What if we lived in a world without a centralized government? And all decisions were voted on by the population. The results of these votes would be extremely sensitive, so we canâ€™t trust any individual to store it in its entirety. We propose a protocol to support Blockchain Voting Ledger for Direct Democracy


## FEATURES:
Our project will be split up into two sections: 1. an internet protocol to handle voting and guard against fraud 2. A blockchain implementation that stores the ballots and their anonymized results.
1. Protocol Layer

2. Blockchain Layer
## Apportionment of Tasks:
Since we are a small team of two people (our assigned teammate Run is AWOL), we will divide the labor according to the above-mentioned sections. Caspar will lead the development of the protocol layer, and Sumya will handle the blockchain implementation. 

## p2pserver():
    1. client/ peer will connect to the peer server. 
    2. differentiate the request type: 
        - client request
            -  Block(block_id,client_side_data, timestamp)
            - put the block to the queue so that the p2pclient can grab the block
        - peer request:
            1. to get the all copy of the blockchain
                - send the blockchain to the connected peer
            2. incoming new block from a peer
                - need to validate the block. After validation send status;
                - if block is validated, add the block to the chain

##  p2pclient(self):
    1. new peer
        - request for the blockcain list to all its peer (get from tracker)
        - if there is only one peer; the peer will wait for couple of seconds to have other peers
          if not found, than the loop won't be executed: 
          ```python
            
            for i in self.all_peers_list:
                
                t = threading.Thread(target=self.init_blockchain, args=(i,))
                t.start()
                all_threads.append(t)
            ```
        - if there are other peers, the loop will be executed, and after the execution
        the p2pclient will check which peer has the largest block_id will accept that blockchain

    2.both old and new peer will check  ```self.enqueue = collections.deque()``` to get the newly created block from p2pserver(). 
        - if block exists, popleft() from enqueue; and broadcast to exisiting peers to get the validation. If maximum peers accepts the blockchain; add the block to the blockain
